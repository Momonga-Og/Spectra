Matches: Each team competes in 2 matches (round-robin format within each group).
Advancement: The top two teams from each group advance to the Elimination Rounds.

2. Elimination Rounds (November 30):
Quarterfinals: The top two teams from each group (8 teams total) compete in single-elimination matches to decide the 4 teams advancing to the Semifinals.
Semifinals: The 4 winning teams from the Quarterfinals face each other in single-elimination matches.
Finals: The last two standing teams compete in a Best of 3 (BO3) match series to determine the Champion.
